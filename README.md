# CodePath TIP102 - Advanced Technical Interview Prep - Problem Set Solutions

Welcome\! This repository contains my solutions to the in-class practice problems for **CodePath's TIP102: Advanced Technical Interview Prep** course from the Summer 2025 session.

I created this space to document my learning journey, track my progress in solving complex problems, and showcase my approach to data structures and algorithms.

As an active work in progress, this repo is continuously updated with new solutions and refinements to existing code. Many problems are first solved collaboratively in class, so I re-implement them myself here to solidify my own understanding as I progress through the course.

## ðŸ’¡ About the Course

CodePath's TIP102 is an intensive, 10-week advanced course designed for students preparing for technical interviews at top-tier tech companies. The curriculum focuses on advanced data structures (e.g., Heaps, Trees, Graphs) and complex algorithmic patterns (e.g., Dynamic Programming, Backtracking).

You can learn more about the course [here](https://www.codepath.org/courses/tech-interview-prep).

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The solutions are organized by week and session, reflecting the structure of the course, with two class sessions per week. Each session includes my implementations for both the standard and advanced problem sets.

```
/Week 01
â””â”€â”€ /Session 1 (01-01)
    â”œâ”€â”€ standard_problems.py
    â””â”€â”€ advanced_problems.py
...
```

## ðŸŒ± My Approach

For each problem, my goal is not just to find a working solution, but to write code that is:

- **Clean and Readable:** Adhering to Python's style conventions.
- **Efficient:** Analyzing and documenting the time and space complexity (e.g., $O(n)$, $O(\\log n)$) for each solution.
- **Well-Documented:** Using comments and docstrings to explain my thought process and logic.
